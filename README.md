  Agent John Doe logs in and sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.
  He also makes sure to leave a proper message:

<p>
  System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:

</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.
</p>
<p>
  She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:

</p>

<br />

<br />
<p>
  Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>

</p>

<p>
  This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this tutorial helps you understand and have a better general overview of a life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depeneding on the company size.
